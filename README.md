## Technical Details

### Data Storage

The application utilizes IndexedDB for data storage, and the Dexie.js library is used to interact with the IndexedDB database. This allows efficient and structured data management within the browser.

### Build Process

The project is built using Webpack, a powerful build tool that helps manage and bundle various assets. Webpack enables features such as code splitting, module bundling, and more, optimizing the application's performance and loading times.

### Project Structure

The application's directory structure is organized as follows:

```
[__tests__]
    ├── project.test.js
    └── todo.test.js
[src]
    ├── index.js
    ├── [modules]
        ├── app.js
        ├── dataService.js
        ├── db.js
        ├── project.js
        ├── render.js
        ├── todo.js
        └── utils.js
    ├── style.css
    └── template.html
webpack.config.js
package.json
```

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the application.
- `dist/`: This directory is generated by Webpack and contains the bundled and optimized code ready for deployment.
- `webpack.config.js`: This file configures the behavior of the Webpack build process.
- `package.json`: This file lists the project's dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.

### Dependencies

Key dependencies used in the project include:

- [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/): A library for simplifying the interaction with IndexedDB.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): A powerful build tool for bundling assets and optimizing code.

Feel free to explore the `package.json` file for a full list of dependencies.

### Development Setup
